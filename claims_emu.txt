This txt file, claims.txt, is part of the assignment of CS321 - CS322 at the 
department of Computer Science and Engg, IIT Patna . 
*****************************************************************************/

Files:
==========
*All the files I submitted, emulator.cpp and claims_emu.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of 
authorship.

* Files included are , emulator.cpp, mybubblesort.o ,test4.o ,test4.asm ,mybubblesort.asm

Compilation instructions:
=========================
	
	g++ emulator.cpp
	./a.out
	It will ask you for the filename first save the file in same folder as emulator.cpp then give the name in .o format
	After that a Menu driven program will offer you different type of instructions.

Assumptions:
============
    * Mnemonic named “data” is always used at the end of assembly code.
    * In trace, printed register values(or SP or PC) are values after execution of the current line

NOTE:
=====
	* Every claim about assembler is already submitted and it satisfies here too (for emulator)
	* all the commands work as mentioned above.

The emulator: 
=============
(some files which were tested)
1. test4.o
	compiles successfully with all functionalities working as mentioned above

2. mybubblesort.o
	compiles successfully with all functionalities working as mentioned above

Can detect errors (if infinite loop or out of bound access such as sp<0)
	*reports it as segmentation fault.
	*For checking infinite loop I have checked if number of instructions become >(2^24 i.e approx 20000000)

all other files are supposed to work fine too.
